  <P>Piggyback is used to summarize child-record data to the parent (similar to a Salesforce Rollup, but more powerful).  Each edit of a child record causes all child records "like that one" to be "rolled up" to the parent record into "PB_" fields.</P>
  <P>In the case of OppToAcct (the first Piggyback mechanism), when an Account is touched, it ALSO causes Piggyback to fire on "all Opportunities" (one for each Product__c reference found, as PB will cycle through ALL OPPS with the same Product__c reference).  This is to effectively "cleanup" PB data on the Account.</P>
